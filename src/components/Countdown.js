          <p> Thank you for the memories and for being a part of my life. Thank you for the bike ride we shared, and for trusting me with your thoughts, your feelings, and your heart. Thank you for the countless hours you spent talking to me in the morning, for the texts, and for simply being there.<br /><br /> Thank you for the moments of laughter, for the times we spent together. Iâ€™ve always found joy in making fun of your looks, but itâ€™s just my way of showing love. If it ever hurt you, I am truly sorry. I only make fun of the people I like and care about.<br /><br /> I know we shared a lot of good times, but I also want to thank you for bringing some sadness into my life. Life canâ€™t always be happy, right? We need the bittersweet moments too, to appreciate everything else.<br /><br /> And hey, if you ever think about drinking or smoking, you can always call me. Iâ€™ll distract you and make sure you donâ€™t go down that road. Iâ€™ll always be here for you, even if itâ€™s just to change your mind.<br /><br /> By the way, remember that bet we made about whose baby would be more beautiful yours or mine? The amount was 10,00,000 rupees, right? Just wanted to remind you that youâ€™ll owe me when that bet is settled, haha. Iâ€™m still confident my baby will take the crown.<br /><br /> The love I had for you was real, and I hope you know that. You deserve a happy life, and I truly wish that you find someone who will care for you in the way you deserve a good, loving husband. I may not be "boyfriend material," but I promise, Iâ€™m "husband material." Just had to throw that out there.<br /><br /> On a lighter note, those modern dresses you wear are absolutely beautiful. I canâ€™t deny that. But when you wear traditional clothes like that stunning green one you wore last Thursday(December 19th 2024) you looked like a million bucks. Iâ€™m pretty sure I saw more than a few boys (and maybe some girls too) eyeing you. If I had to rate you, Iâ€™d give you a solid 9 out of 10. Youâ€™re just that incredible.<br /><br /> And finally, I just want to remind you: Donâ€™t trust everyone. Iâ€™ve always been real with you, and thatâ€™s something thatâ€™s never going to change.<br /><br /> Wishing you the absolute best in life. Youâ€™re an amazing person, and Iâ€™m grateful for the time we shared. </p>
